I'm Dave , an aspiring software engineer.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products, I hope to contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic. I was recently inspired by [**Gazi Jarin**](https://github.com/gazijarin)

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the progression of science and tech, I also checkout cooked job marketsðŸ¤§ I draw, play video games and struggle to get a 100 followers ðŸ¥²  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write books. I'm currently learning Python and Javascript.
